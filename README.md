This repository contains the data used in the computational studies of the paper "Selecting and Scheduling Vulnerability Mitigations with Resource Constraints" by Ashley Peper, Laura Albert, and James Luedtke. 

A python file is included to read in the data and format it in a way that can be easily input into the model used in the paper. 

The data files were created in a way that allows for multiple modes of job completion. All used data only has a single mode per job. The python file reads in the data as if there are mulitple modes per job, but then also simplifies the formatting to match the single mode jobs used in the paper.
